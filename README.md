# Text-Cleaning-Tools-Techniques-Practical-Guide
Introduction
Text cleaning is an essential step when preparing raw data for applications such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analysis. Raw text data often includes noise, such as unwanted symbols, excessive whitespace, or inconsistent formatting. These issues can negatively impact the quality and performance of analytical models.

In this notebook, we will cover text cleaning techniques using two approaches:

Manual Cleaning: Writing systematic code to handle specific issues in text. Using the re Library (Regular Expressions): Employing regular expressions for more efficient and flexible text cleaning. The notebook is structured to first introduce manual methods for handling textual data, providing foundational insights, and then transition to the use of re to streamline the process and address complex patterns. The aim is to give you practical knowledge for cleaning text in a robust and efficient manner.
